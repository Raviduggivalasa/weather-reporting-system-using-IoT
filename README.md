# weather-reporting-system-using-IoT
we are going to construct an IoT based weather monitor system using Arduino which can report us weather status like atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, air quality, light intensity etc. of your locality in real time and the data from the sensors are logged to an IoT cloud service called Thingspeak for monitoring and analysis.
